;My code starts at memory x3000. It then checks to see if the value given at
;the specific memory is pos or neg. It adds the value to R5 if it is positive
;and does nothing if the value is zero or negative. It checks 10 memory
;locations in order and adds all the positive values and store it into R5.

;R1 holds the address that needs to be accessed/Temp register
;R3 holds the value at address R1
;R4 is the counter up to 10.
;R5 holds the sum of the positive numbers

0011 0001 0000 0000 ; x3100 - starting address of the program

; The program description and code starts here
0101 101 101 1 00000 ; AND R5 with 00000 in order to clear it
0101 100 100 1 00000 ; AND R4 with 00000 to clear it
0101 001 001 1 00000; Clear R1
1110 001 000101101 ; Load x3131 into R1
0001 100 100 1 01011 ; Add #11 to R4. I decrement early so I need to make it 1 greater
0001 100 100 1 11111; Add #-1 to R4 or also known as Decrement R4
0000 010 000000100 ; if R4 is zero, jump to the halt command. PC + 4
0001 001 001 1 00001 ; Add #1 to R1 to make it x3132
0110 011 001 000000 ; Load into R3, M[R1]. Load the first value to check
0000 110 111 111011 ; if the number loaded is zero or negative, go back to decrement R4. PC - 5
0001 101 101 0 00 011 ; if the number was pos, add it to R5 and store in R5
0000 001 111111001 ; Go back to the decrement R4 phase. PC - 7
1111 0000 00100101 ; Halt the program
